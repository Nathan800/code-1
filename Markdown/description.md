# ðŸ“š Code Study Notes
## HTML:
- HTML = <ins>"Hypertext Markup Language"</ins>
- HTML was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 

 
**What is the background behind "markup" ?**  
The origins of markup is traced back to a time before computers to the traditional marking up of paper manuscripts.  
This was done to indicate how a text should be formatted for print - specifying fonts, sizes, styles (like italic or bold),  
spacing and structure

**Syntax and Semantics:**
- <ins>Syntax:</ins> the rules for forming valid statements in a language, its about the structure and grammar.
- <ins>Semantic:</ins>  the meaning or interpretation of a valid statement. It's about what the statement does or conveys
- 
> [!NOTE]
> A program can be syntactically correct but semantically incorrect (trying to divide by zero, which is grammatically fine but meaningless in a mathematical context).

**What is the structure of a HTML File ?**

**What is the DOM ?**  
The <ins>Document Object Model (DOM)</ins> is a crucial concept in Web Programming, serving as the bridge between web document (html)  
and scripting languages (JavaScript).

The DOM defines the logical structure of web documents and the way a document is accessed.  
When a Web-Browser loads a HTML page, it doesn't just display text; it builds a live, in-memory  
representation of that page called the DOM.  

**Structure of DOM:**
The DOM represents the document as a <ins>logical tree</ins> of nodes
- each part of the HTML Document (elements, attributes, text, comments) is represented as a node in this tree
